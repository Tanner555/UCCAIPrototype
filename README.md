# UCCAIPrototype

This is a prototype for a Tactical RPG idea I had. It's party based, similar to Isometric RPGs, 
but you can move freely in 3D and tilt the camera around the character. 
This project uses assets such as Opsive's Ultimate Character Controller and Chronos Time Control.

There's currently a lot of issues with the game, such as AI not working properly and controls being unresponsive.

You can try out the game on itch.io. https://tanman555.itch.io/my-tactical-rpg-prototype
