Unity3d property drawer for automatically making enums flags into mask fields in the inspector.

Usage: Put the .cs files somewhere in your project. When you have an enum field you want to turn into a mask field in the inspector, add the EnumFlag attribute over the field. Eg:

[EnumFlag]
MyCustomEnum thisEnum;
// This lets you give the field a custom name in the inspector.
[EnumFlag("Custom Inspector Name")]
MyCustomEnum anotherEnum;

My updates:
-Added modification check to better support multi-object editing
-Added support for the better Unity 2017.3 version of the flag property drawer: EditorGUI.EnumFlagsField()
-Added Nicifier formatting on field name for parameter-less attribute
-Removed "static T GetBaseProperty<T>(SerializedProperty prop)", and replaced it
    with the cleaner "Enum targetEnum = (Enum)Enum.ToObject(fieldInfo.FieldType, property.intValue);" line from another fork

The EnumFlagsAtrribute.cs is the same as other forks
